 * lw_video_sink.h — dmabuf zero-copy video data-plane ABI (v1).
 *
 * Single definition of the decoded-frame descriptor and the sink callback
 * table. This one installed header is shared, verbatim, by the libwebrtc
 * core, the hardware decoder, and every presenter. No other definition of
 * LwDmabufDescriptor / LwVideoSinkV1 may exist.
 *
 * This ABI is process-internal and native-to-native: decoded frames travel
 * decoder -> presenter by reference (dmabuf fds), never crossing into a
 * managed runtime. The control side brokers the track -> sink binding only.

 *               handoff (POD copy), latest-wins. Declining is the drop.
 * Backpressure: pool exhaustion is the only true backpressure (pool sized
 *               reorder + pipeline + 1). HUD watches pool occupancy.
 * Release watchdog (presenter-side, normative): every pending release is
 *               bounded (fence wait w/ timeout ~2 vsync + margin); on expiry
 *               the presenter drops its scanout ref and calls release. The
 *               producer NEVER force-recycles. Producer side raises a
 *               pool-occupancy alarm when occupancy crosses a threshold.
 * Fences:       acquire_fence_fd normally -1. Release timing via KMS
 *               OUT_FENCE_PTR or wl_buffer.release.
 * Evolution:    new fields append; `size` gates; LwVideoSinkV2 when the
 *               function shape must change.
